# Introduction to Quantum Machine Learning

Attached are two notebooks from a presentation I gave on quantum machine learning at a company lunch-and-learn:

* `quantum_neural_net.ipynb` walks through an example of simulating a regression problem on Xanadu's continuous-variables architecture
* `computation_on_hardware.ipynb` shows how to connect to an IBM Quantum Computer to run some simple quantum gates over the cloud
