# Conv2D From Scratch
***

This notebook details how to construct an optimized conv2D transform from scratch using only base python and numpy for an arbitrary number of input feature maps, convolution filters, and channels. Conv2D is the foundation of the convolutional layers used in modern computer vision techniques based on deep learning with neural networks.

Also covered are kernel transforms for:

* Dilated Convolutions
* Custom Sampling Grids

### Usage
* Requires `python 3`, `numpy`, and `jupyter`.
* Launch `conv2D_from_scratch.ipynb`.
