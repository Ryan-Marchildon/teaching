    "## A) Why Recommendation Systems are Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern consumers are flooded with choices. Electronic retailers offer enormous collections of products and content meeting a variety of needs and tastes. Navigating this content can be both overwhelming and time-consuming, and there is no guarantee that the user will find the material best suited to their interests. This in turn negatively impacts the user experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "Case-in-point, today the main reasons why a user abandons an e-commerce experience are: (a) lack of relevance or (b) feeling overwhelmed. \n",
    "\n",
    "So how can we do better? **Recommendation systems** are one response. In brief, recommenders do the hard work of searching through vast collections of content, to surface the content most likely to be of relevance to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Where do we see recommendation systems in modern everyday life? Some easy examples are Amazon, Spotify, and Netflix. All three of these massively successful companies have recommendation services at the core of their user experience. They were early to see the value, and reaped the benefits accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most content- or product-delivering organizations should now consider adopting recommendation systems as part of their strategy. Users are coming to expect more personalized experiences. Matching users with the most appropriate content is key to enhancing user satisfaction and loyalty. With so many vendors to choose from, organizations that fail to adopt a personalization strategy will be left in the dust. \n",

    "## B) Spotting Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider how recommendation systems might apply in each of the following user stories:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Story 1 | E-Commerce:** As a shopper on a large e-catalogue, I'm faced with an overwhelming number of choices and need guidance on finding relevant products that suit my aims and tastes. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Story 2 | Media Platform:** As a user, I want to more easily discover new content (music, tv shows, or articles) that I might enjoy. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Story 3 | Vacation Booking Platform:** As a user booking a vacation, I want to more easily find suitable accommodations, vehicle rentals, and activities that match my needs and tastes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From a user's perspective, common needs that can be a flag for leveraging recommendation systems include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Help me choose. \n",
    "* Help me discover. \n",
    "* Help me achieve my goal. \n",
    "* Help me feel less overwhelmed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, a well-designed recommendation system helps the user achieve their goals faster and more pleasantly. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Brainstorm**: Can you think of other uses? What about recommending prices when you upload an item to a used goods market? Or recommending which restaurants to eat at? ...\n",

    "## C) The Ingredients of a Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendaton systems are powered by `data` collected about your users, your content, and user interactions with your content. This data is used to tune a predictive model which generates recommendations based on content similarity or the recorded history of user actions. \n",

    "3. Data preprocessing pipeline\n",
    "4. Model / Service\n",

    "    * Alternative Least Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll expand on many of these later. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explicit User Feedback**\n",
    "Unbiased data on a user's tastes and preferences. This should be your primary source of data for developing recommendation aglorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "* ratings given (e.g. stars, likes)\n",
    "* product purchases\n",
    "* videos watched (defined by some minimum viewing time)\n",
    "* songs listed to\n",
    "* articles read\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implicit User Feedback**\n",
    "Potentially biased as these can be influenced by how content is presented on a page or by \"click-baitability\". Click-baitable content may have a high click rate, but then a low dwell time or high bounce-back rate. Can be helpful in fine-tuning algorithms or mitigating the cold-start problem, but results will generally be poorer compared to explicit user feedback. \n",

    "* age and demographics\n",
    "* user-completed surveys (e.g. \"which of these are you interested in\"?)\n",
    "* user-specified constraints (e.g. child filter on movies)\n",

    "### D) Recommendations by Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "In collaborative filtering, we leverage trends in user ratings to try to predict which items will be most relevant. *Note: instead of 'ratings', we could just as easily use other forms of explicit user feedback, such as video views, etc.* \n",
    "\n",
    "As a pre-requisite, we need to prepare a user ratings matrix, where the rows correspond to users ($u$), the columns correspond to items ($i$), and the matrix elements correspond to user rankings of each item ($r_{ui}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ratings-matrix.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Above) The ratings of users (b) and (c) are in agreement with user (e) on all items for which user (e) has provided a rating. Can we therefore use the ratings from users (b) and (c) to predict user (e)'s rating of the laptop?*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of collaborative filtering, which attack the same problem from slightly different angles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **User-Based**: We look at users with similar item ratings patterns as you, and see how those users rated other items to select our recommendations. \n",
    "> *\"Users like me also looked at these other items...\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/user-based-cf.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Item-Based**: We look at which users rated a given item highly, and see how those users rated other items to select our recommendations. \n",
    "> *\"Users who looked at this item also looked at these other items...\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/item-based-cf.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",

Think of each item as having a corresponding orthogonal geometric axis, and the rating for that item corresponds to the distance along that axis. A user's tastes are thus represented by a coordinate in multi-dimensional item space, pointed to by $\\vec{r}$. If we want to measure the similarity of two users, we can do so mathematically by calculating how 'close' these vectors are in item space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we use **cosine similarity**, which is simply the normalized inner product (overlap) of two vectors. If we consider two different users, $u$ and $u'$ with corresponding ratings vectors $\\vec{r}_{u}$ and $\\vec{r}_{u'}$, their cosine similarity is given by:\n",

    "* A value of 0 corresponds to zero overlap; e.g. the two users have rated completely different films. \n",
    "* A value of -1 might correspond to users who rated the same films but gave opposite ratings. \n",

    "We could compute the similarity matrix by iterating over each row and column of the ratings matrix, but this would be computationally expensive and take a long time to complete for large datasets. So instead we'll take advantage of python's vectorized functions. It can be proven that the computation is equivalent to: \n",

Two mitigation strategies that are simple and intuitive are: `anti-flood`, where we penalize the 2nd and 3rd recommendations if they have almost the same similarity scores to the top result; `dithering`, where we add a wildcard recommendation to keep things interesting for the user and generate new datapoints (e.g. for newly-introduced products). \n",

This leads to high bounce rates after initially high clickthrough rates. \n",

Hybrid (e.g. content-based and collaborative-based) methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Be Sensitive to Ethics`. Recommendations can bring great value to clients and their users when deployed responsibly. However, we all occasionally hear stories about recommendation systems gone wrong. Facebook recently came under intense criticism about its news feed recommendations, which create an echo chamber that amplifies the polarization of extreme political views. This could have been addressed by including more diversity of viewpoints in the articles being recommended. Another well-known story is when Target predicted that a teenage girl was pregnant based on her shopping habits and sent a tailored brochure of recommended baby products to her family address. We should consider not only privacy around data, but also privacy around the recommendations themselves. The onus is on us to anticipate possible implications of our recommendation systems and include responses to these in our design thinking process. "
